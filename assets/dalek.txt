Open the bulkhead, or Rose Tyler dies.
I want... freedom.
And the coward survived.
I am alone in the universe.
Why do we survive?
I am the last of the Daleks.
I can feel. So many ideas. So much darkness. Rose, give me orders. Order me to die.
This is not life. This is sickness. I shall not be like you. Order my destruction! Obey! *Obey*! O-BEY!
Keep back!
I am waiting for orders.
I am a solider, I was bred to receive orders.
I DEMAND ORDERS!
You lie!
You destroyed us?
And what of the Time Lords?
There is only one form of life that matters: Dalek life. Obey your ordersâ€¦
